# Colocalization Object Counter
An ImageJ plugin for semi-automatic object based colocalization analysis

ImageJ plugin source code, Microsoft Excel macro file, and Matlab script will be uploaded post-publication.


This ImageJ plugin enables semi-automatic identification and quantification of image objects, with the opportunity to employ varying degrees of automation as desired. The  colocalization Object Counter is optimized for annotating and keeping track of each objectâ€™s colocalization category, that is, which fluorescent label(s) are associated with each object. The plugin also contains basic tools for subsequent 3D reconstruction of object and tissue contour data.
